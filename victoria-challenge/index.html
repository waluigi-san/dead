## Introduction

<span class="lead">Started in July 1987,</span> the Victoria Challenge aims to allow classes to identify task which will contribute tangibly to the school. This contribution can be either aesthetic or ‘atmospheric’. The Challenge is for classes to plan their task carefully and pledge to complete it within the time allocated. It is conducted once every 4 years and has always been regarded by students as a high in their student life in Victoria School.

Special T-Shirts were even being designed for every Victoria Challenge.
